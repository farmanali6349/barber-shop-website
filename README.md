# Barber Shop Website (Responsive)

## [Live Website](https://barbers-by-farmanali6349.netlify.app/)

## Tools Utilized:
I used HTML, CSS and JS to create webpage. I used Visual Studio as a text editor for the project.

## Description:
This is a barber shop website that I made after getting inspired by a youtube tutorial of "easy tutorials" by video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBfshkPlMW8 and inpired by website template at colorlib https://colorlib.com/.

## Process:
First of all I did an hands on practice with the tutrial of "easytutorials". Then I got some inspirations on colorlib. I decided that which sections I will include in my website. So I concluded to use
1- Hero Section
2- Services
3- Pricing
4- Expert section (Barbers)
5- Gallery
6- Testimonial

And After That I sketch out their desing and start building it the sketch is give at my portfolio at behance. I used text animation at the header as I upload the first video of animation series "Zahra" name hero page.

## Design:
After sketching out, I created a logo (actually modified a template one at canva). The logo contained the golden hair graphic. So I picked my primary color from logo and second color (body) color, I matched from coolers https://coolors.co/.

## Learnings:
First time I start to use a technique to build out a website i.e sketching out the desings and thinking the logics for that website.
